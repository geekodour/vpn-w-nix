Main differences:
1. OpenVPN open source is a self-hosted, open-source solution, while OpenVPN Access Server and CloudConnexa are commercial products.
2. OpenVPN Access Server offers a graphical web interface, automated certificate creation, pre-configured client software, and advanced user management features that the open-source version lacks.
3. CloudConnexa is a cloud-based service that provides easy deployment, scalability, and value-added security features like content filtering and IDS/IPS, which the other two solutions do not offer.
4. Both OpenVPN Access Server and CloudConnexa support connecting networks with overlapping IP subnets and provide site-to-site connectivity, while the open-source version only supports site-to-site connections.
